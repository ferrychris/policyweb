# AI Model Management Policy

**Policy Number:** MDL-AI-001  
**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Last Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Next Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Policy Owner:** Chief AI Officer

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes requirements for the development, deployment, monitoring, and retirement of AI models. It applies to all AI models used within [Organization Name], whether developed internally or acquired from third parties.

## 2. Key Definitions

- **Model:** A computational representation trained on data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Model Lifecycle:** The stages a model goes through from conception to retirement.
- **Model Registry:** A repository for storing model versions and associated metadata.
- **Model Drift:** Degradation in model performance due to changes in data patterns over time.
- **Model Governance:** The framework for managing and controlling models throughout their lifecycle.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Model Development Standards

1. All models must be developed according to approved methodologies and best practices.
2. Model development must follow a standardized process including:
   - Problem formulation
   - Data exploration and preparation
   - Feature engineering
   - Algorithm selection
   - Training and validation
   - Performance evaluation
   - Documentation

3. Model development environments must be separated from production environments.
4. Model code must adhere to the organization's coding standards.
5. Version control must be used for all model code and configurations.

### 3.2 Model Documentation Requirements

All AI models must be documented with:

1. Intended purpose and use cases
2. Training data sources and preprocessing methods
3. Model architecture and hyperparameters
4. Performance metrics and evaluation results
5. Limitations and constraints
6. Testing methodology and results
7. Ethical considerations and bias assessments
8. Validation approach and results

### 3.3 Model Approval Process

1. Models must undergo formal review and approval before deployment.
2. Approval requirements vary based on model risk level:
   - High-risk models: Executive AI Committee approval
   - Medium-risk models: AI Governance Committee approval
   - Low-risk models: Business unit and AI team approval

3. Approval decisions must be documented in the model registry.
4. Changes to approved models must go through appropriate change management processes.

### 3.4 Model Deployment

1. Models must be deployed using standardized procedures.
2. Pre-deployment testing must validate model performance in the target environment.
3. Deployment plans must include rollback procedures.
4. Model metadata must be registered in the model registry upon deployment.
5. Access controls must be implemented to prevent unauthorized model modifications.

### 3.5 Model Monitoring and Maintenance

1. All deployed models must be monitored for:
   - Performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
   - Data drift
   - Concept drift
   - Resource utilization
   - Errors and exceptions

2. Monitoring frequency must be based on model risk level and criticality.
3. Alert thresholds must be defined for key performance indicators.
4. Model retraining schedules must be established based on model characteristics.
5. Performance degradation must trigger investigation and remediation.

### 3.6 Model Retirement

1. Criteria for model retirement must be defined.
2. Retirement decisions must be documented.
3. Retirement procedures must ensure:
   - Appropriate notification to stakeholders
   - Orderly transition to replacement models (if applicable)
   - Secure decommissioning of model resources
   - Archiving of model artifacts for audit purposes

4. Data retention policies must be applied to retired model data.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Chief AI Officer:** Policy ownership and oversight
- **AI Governance Committee:** Model approval and governance oversight
- **Model Risk Management Team:** Model risk assessment and validation
- **AI/ML Engineers:** Model development and implementation
- **Data Scientists:** Model design, training, and evaluation
- **Business Stakeholders:** Use case definition and business requirements
- **Operations Team:** Model deployment and monitoring

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

1. Model development should follow the organization's AI development methodology.
2. Model documentation should use standardized templates.
3. The model registry should be the central repository for all model information.
4. Model monitoring should leverage automated tools where possible.

## 6. Compliance Monitoring

1. Regular audits will verify compliance with model management requirements.
2. Model inventory reviews will be conducted quarterly.
3. Model performance reviews will be conducted according to the monitoring schedule.
4. Compliance metrics will be reported to the AI Governance Committee.

## 7. Review and Update Procedures

1. This policy will be reviewed annually by the AI Governance Committee.
2. Updates will reflect evolving best practices and lessons learned.
3. Changes to the policy require approval from the Chief AI Officer.
4. All stakeholders will be notified of policy updates.
