# AI Security Policy

**Policy Number:** SEC-AI-001  
**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Last Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Next Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Policy Owner:** Chief AI Officer / Chief Information Security Officer

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes security requirements for AI systems to protect against unauthorized access, adversarial attacks, and other security threats. It applies to all AI systems developed, deployed, or used by [Organization Name].

## 2. Key Definitions

- **AI Security:** Protection of AI systems from threats that could compromise their integrity, confidentiality, or availability.
- **Adversarial Attack:** Intentional manipulation of AI systems to cause incorrect outputs or behaviors.
- **Model Poisoning:** Contamination of training data to compromise model performance or security.
- **Model Inversion:** Technique to extract private training data from a model.
- **Model Stealing:** Extraction of model parameters or architecture through systematic queries.
- **Security by Design:** Approach that incorporates security from the start of system development.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Security by Design Principles

1. Security requirements must be defined at the start of AI projects.
2. Threat modeling must be conducted during the design phase.
3. Security reviews must be conducted at key development milestones.
4. Security testing must be integrated into the AI development lifecycle.

### 3.2 Adversarial Robustness

1. AI models must be evaluated for robustness against adversarial attacks.
2. Appropriate adversarial defense mechanisms must be implemented based on risk level.
3. Models must be regularly tested with adversarial examples.
4. Adversarial robustness metrics must be established and monitored.

### 3.3 Data Security

1. Training data must be protected against unauthorized access or modification.
2. Data poisoning detection measures must be implemented.
3. Secure data pipelines must be established for all AI workflows.
4. Sensitive training data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 3.4 Model Security

1. Model access must be controlled and monitored.
2. Model deployment procedures must include security validation.
3. Models must be protected against extraction, inversion, and stealing attacks.
4. Model updates must undergo security testing before deployment.

### 3.5 Operational Security

1. AI systems must be integrated into the organization's security monitoring framework.
2. Security logging must be implemented for all AI operations.
3. Incident response procedures must include AI-specific scenarios.
4. AI systems must comply with the organization's security patching policy.

### 3.6 Supply Chain Security

1. Third-party AI components must undergo security assessment before use.
2. Vendor security practices must be evaluated during procurement.
3. Security requirements must be included in AI vendor contracts.
4. Supply chain risk assessments must be conducted for critical AI systems.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Chief Information Security Officer:** Overall security strategy and oversight
- **Chief AI Officer:** Ensuring AI-specific security requirements are met
- **AI Security Team:** Implementing AI security measures and conducting testing
- **AI Developers/Engineers:** Implementing secure coding practices
- **Operations Team:** Maintaining secure operational environments
- **Risk Management:** Assessing security risks in AI systems
- **Compliance Team:** Ensuring security controls meet regulatory requirements

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

1. Security requirements must be documented in AI project plans.
2. Security testing results must be reviewed before deployment approval.
3. Security incidents involving AI systems must be reported immediately.
4. Security training specific to AI must be provided to relevant personnel.

## 6. Compliance Monitoring

1. Regular security assessments will be conducted on AI systems.
2. Penetration testing will be performed annually on high-risk AI systems.
3. Security monitoring will be continuous for production AI systems.
4. Security compliance will be reported to the AI Governance Committee.

## 7. Review and Update Procedures

1. This policy will be reviewed annually by the Security and AI teams.
2. Updates will be made to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
3. Changes to the policy require approval from the CISO and Chief AI Officer.
4. All stakeholders will be notified of policy updates.
