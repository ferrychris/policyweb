# AI Data Governance Policy

**Policy Number:** DATA-AI-001  
**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Last Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Next Review Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Policy Owner:** Chief AI Officer / Chief Data Officer

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes requirements for managing data used in AI systems, ensuring quality, privacy, security, and compliance. It applies to all data used in AI initiatives, including training, testing, validation, and production data.

## 2. Key Definitions

- **Data Governance:** The overall management of data availability, usability, integrity, and security.
- **Data Quality:** The measure of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context.
- **Data Lineage:** Documentation of data's origins, movements, transformations, and use.
- **Data Privacy:** Protection of personally identifiable information and sensitive data.
- **Training Data:** Data used to train AI models.
- **Testing Data:** Data used to evaluate AI model performance.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Data Quality Requirements

1. All data used for AI initiatives must meet defined quality standards:
   - Accuracy: Data correctly represents the real-world entity or event
   - Completeness: Required data elements are present
   - Consistency: Data values are consistent across datasets
   - Timeliness: Data is sufficiently current for the intended use
   - Relevance: Data is appropriate for the specific AI use case
   - Representativeness: Data adequately represents the full range of scenarios

2. Data quality assessments must be conducted before data is used for AI training or inference.
3. Data quality issues must be documented and remediated before use.
4. Ongoing data quality monitoring must be implemented for production AI systems.

### 3.2 Data Privacy and Protection

1. All data used in AI systems must be classified according to the organization's data classification scheme.
2. Processing of personal or sensitive data must comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
3. Privacy impact assessments must be conducted for AI systems processing personal data.
4. Data minimization principles must be applied:
   - Only collect data necessary for the specific AI purpose
   - Limit retention to the minimum necessary period
   - Limit access to those with a legitimate need

5. De-identification or anonymization techniques must be applied where appropriate.
6. Consent management procedures must be implemented where required.

### 3.3 Data Lifecycle Management

1. All AI data must have a defined lifecycle with clear policies for:
   - Collection/acquisition
   - Processing and transformation
   - Storage
   - Use
   - Archival
   - Deletion

2. Data retention periods must be defined for all AI data types.
3. Secure data deletion procedures must be implemented when data reaches end-of-life.
4. Training data versioning must be implemented to support model reproducibility.

### 3.4 Data Documentation and Lineage

1. Data provenance must be documented for all data used in AI systems.
2. Data transformations and preprocessing steps must be recorded.
3. Data lineage must be maintainable throughout the AI system lifecycle.
4. Documentation must include known limitations or biases in the data.

### 3.5 Data Access and Security

1. Access to AI data must be controlled based on the principle of least privilege.
2. Authentication and authorization controls must be implemented for all data access.
3. Data encryption must be implemented for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
4. Data access logs must be maintained and regularly reviewed.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Chief Data Officer:** Overall data governance oversight
- **Chief AI Officer:** Ensuring AI initiatives comply with data governance requirements
- **Data Stewards:** Day-to-day management of data quality and governance
- **AI Project Managers:** Ensuring project compliance with data governance requirements
- **Data Engineers/Scientists:** Implementing data governance practices in AI pipelines
- **Privacy Officer:** Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations
- **IT Security:** Implementing data security controls

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

1. Data quality assessments must be conducted using the organization's data quality framework.
2. Data privacy compliance must be validated by the Privacy Office.
3. Data lineage tools should be utilized to automate documentation where possible.
4. Data governance metrics should be included in AI project reviews.

## 6. Compliance Monitoring

1. Regular data quality audits will be conducted on AI datasets.
2. Privacy compliance reviews will be conducted annually.
3. Data access reviews will be conducted quarterly.
4. Data governance metrics will be reported to the AI Governance Committee.

## 7. Review and Update Procedures

1. This policy will be reviewed annually by the Data Governance Committee.
2. Updates will be made to reflect changes in regulations and best practices.
3. Changes to the policy require approval from the Chief Data Officer and Chief AI Officer.
4. All stakeholders will be notified of policy updates.
