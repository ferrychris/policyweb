### 3.1 Ethical Principles

All AI initiatives must adhere to the following core ethical principles, which are aligned with regulatory expectations and industry standards:

- **Fairness:** AI systems must be designed to treat all individuals and groups fairly, avoiding unfair bias or discrimination. Disparate impact analysis must be conducted for all customer-facing or personnel-related AI applications. Regular fairness audits must be conducted and documented according to Procedure ETH-PROC-001 (AI Fairness Testing).

- **Transparency:** The operation of AI systems must be appropriately explainable and transparent to stakeholders. The degree of explainability required shall be proportionate to the impact and criticality of the AI system's decisions. All customer-facing AI systems must include appropriate disclosures when AI is being used. Documentation requirements are defined in Standard ETH-STD-002 (AI Transparency Requirements).

- **Privacy:** AI systems must respect user privacy and comply with all applicable data protection regulations including GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other jurisdictional requirements. Privacy Impact Assessments must be conducted for all AI systems processing personal data according to Procedure PRIV-PROC-001 (Privacy Impact Assessment).

- **Security:** AI systems must be designed with security considerations from the outset, following Standard SEC-STD-001 (AI Security by Design). Vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and adversarial testing must be conducted at defined intervals based on risk classification.

- **Human autonomy:** AI systems should augment human capabilities without unduly restricting human agency, dignity, or decision-making authority. Impact on human autonomy must be assessed during ethical reviews and documented according to Template ETH-TEMP-003 (Human Agency Impact Assessment).

- **Reliability:** AI systems must be reliable, performing as intended and minimizing errors. Performance benchmarks must be established before deployment, with ongoing monitoring and periodic validation testing. Reliability standards are defined in Standard MDL-STD-005 (AI Reliability Requirements).

- **Accountability:** Clear lines of responsibility must be established for all AI systems, with designated accountable executives for each system. An accountability matrix must be maintained according to Template GOV-TEMP-002 (AI Accountability Matrix).

- **Sustainability:** AI systems should be designed and operated in an environmentally sustainable manner, with consideration for energy efficiency and resource utilization. Environmental impact considerations must be documented according to Template ETH-TEMP-004 (AI Environmental Impact Assessment).

- **Societal Benefit:** AI systems should contribute positively to society, with consideration for their broader impact on communities, economic opportunity, and human well-being. Societal impact assessments must be conducted for high-risk AI systems according to Procedure ETH-PROC-002 (Societal Impact Assessment).

### 3.2 Ethical Review Process

1. All AI initiatives must undergo ethical review, with the depth and rigor of review proportionate to the system's risk classification:
   - High-risk systems: Comprehensive review by the full AI Ethics & Regulatory Compliance Committee
   - Medium-risk systems: Review by a designated subcommittee with ratification by the Chair

2. Ethical reviews must be conducted at multiple stages:
   - Initial concept and design phase
   - Prior to development
   - Before production deployment
   - After significant modifications
   - Periodically throughout the system lifecycle based on risk level (annually for high-risk, biennially for medium-risk)

3. The AI Ethics & Regulatory Compliance Committee will conduct ethical reviews using the organization's Ethics Assessment Framework (ETH-FRMK-001), which incorporates industry standards, regulatory expectations, and best practices.

4. Reviews must evaluate and document:
   - Potential ethical impacts on all stakeholder groups
   - Alignment with organizational values and ethical principles
   - Regulatory compliance implications
   - Mitigating controls and their effectiveness
   - Residual ethical risks and their acceptability
